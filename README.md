> *This package allows you to install Watchdog quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

A watchdog service makes sure your server is still running and reboots it if necessary.
It better (only?) works if your server has a hardware watchdog device.

The included sercice will regularly write to `/dev/watchdog`. If it stops, then the freeze is detected and server rebooted.

This app has only been tested on Raspberry Pi.


**Shipped version:** 5.16~ynh1
