> *This package allows you to install Watchdog quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

A Watchdog device makes sure that your server is still running.
The included service will regularly write to that watchdog device. If it stops doing so, most likely due to a freeze, then the server will be rebooted.

This Watchdog better (only?) works if you have a hardware watchdog integrated in your server. It has only been tested on Raspberry Pi so far.


**Shipped version:** 5.16~ynh1
